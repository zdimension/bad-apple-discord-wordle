# Bad Apple in Discord Wordle

[![Youtube Video](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e780f3cf-a6fb-48e4-9836-dc3fc1c65ccf)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuetI1M_S7E)

## Usage

Run process_wordle.py. On Windows, you might need to edit the file and change the path used for `TEMP_FOLDER` to something like `C:\Temp` or whatever.

It'll generate a file called wordle.js.

On Discord, when you have the Wordle screen open, press Ctrl+Shift+I to open the Dev Console. Using the element selector:

<img width="53" height="66" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/08dc783e-0850-470a-86ae-5f1e5fd0b7f6" />

select your user results panel

<img width="321" height="379" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bf417515-4cc3-4aa1-9995-47e5aea9ff8a" />

then in the HTML tree click on the `BoardContainer` div

<img width="410" height="126" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/638966e5-7dac-4415-9e27-095a0b1a20e4" />

Once that's done, in the console, paste the contents of the wordle.js file. You might need to type "allow pasting" (then Enter) for the console to let you paste code. After the code is pasted, run it with Enter and the animation should start.
